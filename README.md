## Requirements

    C++ compiler (e.g. g++)
    Socket libraries (e.g. sys/socket.h, arpa/inet.h)

## Installation

    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/client-server-socket-cpp.git
    Navigate to the project directory: cd client-server-socket-cpp
    Compile the server code: g++ -o server server.cpp
    Compile the client code: g++ -o client client.cpp

## Usage

    Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
    Start the server: ./server
    In another terminal window, start the client: ./client
    Enter a message in the client terminal window and press enter. The message will be sent to the server and the server will respond with the same message.
    The client terminal window will display the response from the server.
